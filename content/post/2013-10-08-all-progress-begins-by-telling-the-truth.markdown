The credit for that particular variation of insight goes to Dan Sullivan. Many other people have said it in similar ways over the centuries.

For example, in the Bible - John 8:32


<blockquote>"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</blockquote>


So this blog is my attempt at making some progress, by telling the truth, and putting my very private life on the Internet for all to see. Although you might notice that the search engines have been excluded :-)

It's taken me a couple of years to get around to publishing these posts, because it's so embarrassing to admit all of my failures. I am inspired reading other people's stories of turning failure into success, it's just that I'm still at the failure part.

One of the inspirations for this blog is [Perry Marshall](http://www.perrymarshall.com). I've taken a number of online marketing classes from Perry Marshall, and he does a good job of looking back and describing his early failures. And they are epic failures, and make interesting reading, no doubt about it.

I've been influenced by Bren√© Brown (a fellow Houstonian) from her short talk called "[The Power Of Vulnerability](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html)" on TED.

I've also read her book [Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms-ebook/dp/B007P7HRS4/ref=sr_1_1). So I know I'm not alone in experiencing shame and vulnerability. And I want to agree with her conclusions that the best way to live life is to face these feelings head on.

I'm an avid reader of [Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com), where along with Personal Knowledge Management and Knowledge Networks, he talks about "Working Out Loud". I do think that the future is groups of people in fluid networks, and I want to participate. I've spent too many years working in my cave by myself.

The truth about me is that I've stayed in my comfort zone far too long, and have spent many long hours doing tasks that other people could do in a few minutes. Or just ignoring other tasks because I don't like to do them at all.

So this blog is my attempt at working out loud. I'm planning on writing on a regular basis, and telling the world what I'm learning and what I'm going to do. And I'm not worried if any competitors should stumble across this site. For one thing, nobody in my industry is paying any attention. And even if they were, they don't care and wouldn't believe it if they did.

I like the idea of helping people run online communities, but I'm not able to make any further progress by myself. Actually, the only reason I'm still in business is that I got lucky and found a brilliant programmer in a low cost country that has re-written all my software. So my software has gone from worst in the industry to best in the industry !

The next step is to find a few more brilliant and passionate people, and scale this system up so that we can help millions of people communicate with their own small tribes, inside their own virtual community.
