](/uploads/2013/12/competition.jpeg)Mailing list software is relatively simple and easy to create. There have been dozens, if not hundreds of group mailing list solutions created over the past 25 years. Most of those packages have fallen by the wayside as time goes by. Mainly because the programmers left, and the packages have never been updated to handle new wrinkles in the email world like HTML email, SPF, DKIM or VERP.

Lsoft gets credit for automating the group mailing list, and has had commercial products since 1986. They even have a trademark on the word "Listserv". They have versions that you can run on your computers, or have them host it on their servers. Some versions are oriented towards email marketing, and others for email discussion groups.

Lsoft is based in Sweden, and has an American office. According to Hoovers, [Lsoft had $7 million dollars in revenue last year and emerged from Chapter 11 in 2009.](http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.L-Soft_international_Inc.393bb64da961b36a.html)

For a typical Professional Management Organization email discussion group, that has 1,000 members and sends 15 messages a day, Lsoft would host that mailing list for approximately $1,200 per month.

Lyris runs[ hosted mailing lists for approximately 8,000 clients](http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.Lyris_Inc.acb80ca164521108.html), according to Hoovers. Most of these would be email marketing services using Lyris's SaaS product Lyris HQ.

In addition, the older Lyris Listmanager product can run on the client's in-house computers and run either marketing email or discussion groups. Lyris has sold the Listmanager software to some ISP's to run mailing lists for their clients.

The same mailing list that has 1,000 members and sends 15 messages a day, is too small for Lyris to bother with, and they would point you to their affiliates at [Fulcrum Tech](http://www.fulcrumtech.net), [Clickmail](http://clickmail.com) or [NetAtlantic](https://www.netatlantic.com/emailmarketing/discussiongrouphosting/discussion-group-hosting).

[Listbox](https://www.listbox.com) is part PoBox and a long time email hosting provider. I'm not sure what software is running their service.

The same mailing list that has 1,000 members and sends 15 messages a day, Listbox would charge approximately $900 per month.

[NetAtlantic](https://www.netatlantic.com/emailmarketing/discussiongrouphosting/discussion-group-hosting) is a long time ISP that offers both email marketing and discussion group list hosting. NetAtlantic uses the Lyris software to manage their email discussion groups.

The same mailing list that has 1,000 members and sends 15 messages a day, NetAtlantic would charge approximately $175 per month.

The same mailing list that has 1,000 members and sends 15 messages a day, [Mail-List.com](http://www.mail-list.com/pricing/) would charge approximately $125 per month.

[Yahoo Groups](http://groups.yahoo.com) is an email based discussion group, with some message board features like electronic file repository and polls. It is a free service, although using a Yahoo id is strongly encouraged, if not enforced. The ability of a Yahoo Group owner to directly add subscribers to the list has been removed in the update of August 2013.

[Google Groups](http://groups.google.com) is another free service for special interest groups, that is primarily email based. Google forces all members of a group to use a Gmail address.

Since many people use their web browser to access their email on a web site like Hotmail, Yahoo or Gmail, Yahoo and Google Groups looks somewhat similar to a message board.

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com) provide free discussion groups, and anybody can start a new group on those platforms.

[Breeze by 37 Signals](https://basecamp.com/breeze) both launched and closed during the first 6 months of 2013. 37 Signals is an experienced SaaS company with successful products like Basecamp and Highrise. The reason cited on their web site was not enough customers.

Breeze limited itself to groups of less than 50 members, and charged a one time, lifetime fee of $20. Both of those strategies seem a little odd, although they were certainly changable.

[Mailman](http://www.list.org) is a free open source mailing list package that has been around since 1998, and is a mature reliable product. Version 3 has been vaporware for a few years now, but public posts continue to forecast a release very soon.

Many ISP's use Mailman to provide free mailing lists to their web hosting companies. Many companies use Mailman for both internal and external support groups. Both types of users provide their own hardware and technical support. There is no hosted mailing list service using Mailman.

There is a surprisingly wide range of prices for an email discussion group, nearly 20 years after the arrival of the Internet age. For a group of 1,000 members, sending 15 messages per day, the price ranges from free to $14,400 per year.

In addition to these email based online community providers, there are countless companies and open source projects providing software and services for web based message boards.
