](/uploads/2013/12/gaps.jpeg)In general, email discussion software has not changed much in decades. I am not seeing new features, and you can probably count the number of active programmers in the whole industry on one hand.

Lsoft is very expensive, especially for active groups, as they charge a bandwidth fee for each message sent.

They probably have their own data center, which compared to the cloud has lots of disadvantages, including a single location, high fixed overhead, higher variable costs, lack of career opportunities for their operations employees, and no research budget.

Lsoft has an old software base that has not changed much in decades, although they do release a new version every year or so. Their commands and documentation are cryptic, although their web interface is able to hide much of their antiquity.

The email discussion group services of Lyris, Listbox and Netatlantic are a tiny part of their company and not their main focus.

Lsoft, Lyris and Listbox can be attacked on price and features. Netatlantic has reasonable prices but uses the Lyris software, and cannot adapt to changing environments.

The Mailman open source software is a fine product, but it requires that you run the software yourself. You need an experienced system administrator to install and maintain the software. They have to maintain both the Mailman software, as well as the underlying Linux operating system and the hardware it runs on.

These types of people are very valuable to any organization, and running mailing lists is not one of their most productive uses. And yet when there are problems with the mailing list, it moves to their top priority task.

Typically any one organization does not deliver enough emails to establish a good reputation. While there may not be any complaints about the emails, there is just not enough traffic from their IP addresses to warrant inclusion in the reputation databases. And no reputation for an IP address is just as bad as a poor reputation. So consistent delivery into the subscriber's email boxes is a challenge.

Using a shared web hosting company for hardware and Internet access for a mailing list is a bad idea, as their IP addresses are typically blacklisted due to all the spam coming from hacked web sites hosted there.

So while the Mailman software is free, and many companies have an extra computer to run it on, it's not a good use of their system administrator's time and energies.

Google and Yahoo Groups exist for the sole benefit of those organizations, by providing valuable demographic data for their advertising networks, in addition to being able to advertise directly to the subscribers.

The inability to add members directly to the Groups at Yahoo and Google is crippling for membership organizations, because it's difficult and time consuming to get new members on the list. And the members typically don't want or use Yahoo or Gmail, so the messages do not come in to their primary mailbox, thus limiting their participation.

Most groups on Yahoo or Google don't realize it, but you can't export your past messages to move to another place.

Linkedin Groups tend to be spam magnets, with people using them to promote their business. Some marketing gurus teach people to ask questions on Linkedin Groups while other gurus teach people to answer questions on Linkedin Groups to attract new business. This creates a lot of noise, but very few meaningful discussions, and the value of a Linkedin Group to most members is minimal.

With all of the free services, you are not a paying customer, and there are going to be constant changes in all aspects of their service as these companies seek to maximize their profit. Including the possibility of eliminating the free service.

There are probably tens of thousands of email based online communities in existence today, and very little innovation. And tens of thousands more message boards. I see a lot of opportunity here, as email is not dead, and the migration to mobile devices is shaking things up in favor of email.
