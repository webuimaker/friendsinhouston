](/uploads/2013/12/incubators.jpeg)Business incubators and accelerators are the same, yet a bit different.

A business incubator provides resources to a startup business, in exchange for a portion of the company, typically over a several year period. Office space, advisors and introductions to potential clients are all pretty typical resources that the incubator provides.

A business accelerator does the same sort of stuff, but typically within 3 or 4 months. The business needs to be at a more advanced stage, and the business typically gives up a smaller percentage of equity than an incubator.

Both of these are different than venture capital and angel money, where they inject a chunk of cash into your business, in addition to whatever other help they can provide.

There have been thousands of business incubators over the past 15 years, and the vast majority of them are out of business themselves. Not that surprising, given the high failure rate of new businesses.

I'm not sure if incubators and accelerators help or hurt a young business. Certainly there are many success stories, and many of those success stories are willing to give lots of credit to their incubator. It's just that we never hear about the failures.

Because the successful startups had a plan and were also willing to take the advice of their mentors, and that advice was good advice. And each success story probably has a bit of good luck in there too.

But not all advice from an incubator is good advice. Or it might be sound business advice, but not applicable to that entrepreneur. That is, the advice is different from the entrepreneur's vision, divergent from their core skills, or way outside their comfort zone, and they are unable to execute that advice.

I was in a business incubator one time, and it was the worst experience in my life. Not just the 6 months in the incubator, but it precipitated a year long period of depression in my life.

I got involved with an incubatorÂ on the west side of Houston in the early part of 1995. The executive director was a very smart fellow, but ethically challenged. He was seducing the ladies in the program and taking application fees from people without the skill set of running their own business. And getting participants to spend many hours doing work to advance the incubator, instead of their own business.

Anytime you share control of your company with somebody else, you run the risk that your visions will diverge. And that is not necessarily bad. But you also run the risk that they have evil intentions from the git-go. It's a real challenge for new entrepreneurs to discern the difference between the good people and the bad people in this field, because we are so naive and vulnerable at that point.

Do you have any direct experience with business incubators that you are willing to share ?
