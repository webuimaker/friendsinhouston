](/uploads/2013/12/on_paper.jpeg)I had a paper route when I was 9 years old, delivering the Northland News for a penny a piece. It was the free local newspaper in my neighborhood, and it came out once a week. Later on I delivered the paid daily newspaper, the Columbus Dispatch. I didn't do any selling, but I did have to knock on doors and collect the money.

I cut grass and shoveled snow for neighbors on an irregular basis. I remember setting up a putt putt course with my brother in the backyard, and getting neighborhood kids to pony up a quarter to play.

When I was around 16, I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal with my own money. And a little later, also to Forbes Magazine.

Both my junior and senior year in high school, I was in Junior Achievement, and was president of my company both years. In 1972, I attended the National Junior Achievement Conference at Indiana University.

I graduated with a business degree from Ohio State University.

So why has starting and running a business been such a challenge?

I think it's directly related to the size of my vision. My vision was not so much about a business, or making a billion dollars, as it was to keep me in spending money without having a boss. And to build a "system" that could run by itself.

And I have been successful in having my time all to myself. I do work 10 or more hours a day, but it's the 10 hours I want to work, and it's been doing fun and challenging things that I want to do.

Now that I've achieved my goal of building an easy to use, easy to support mailing list system, I'm sort of bored and burnt-out. I've been coming to work, going through the motions but not accomplishing anything. First time that has ever happened in the past 18 years.

So I need a new vision, something with new challenges and goals. I'm still like my software system and I still want to help people communicate inside "Special Interest Groups". And now that my software works, I'm ready to do it on a much larger scale.

I'm going to need some people to help, and they are going to have different skills than I do. And they are going to need to be geniuses at those skills.

Have you ever reached a goal you set for yourself, and then felt a real letdown ?
