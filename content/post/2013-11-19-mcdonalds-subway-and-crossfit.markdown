](/uploads/2013/12/mcdonalds.jpeg)Wikipedia defines franchising as


<blockquote>Franchising is the practice of using another firm's successful business model.

Essentially, and in terms of distribution, the franchisor is a supplier who allows an operator, or a franchisee, to use the supplier's trademark and distribute the supplier's goods. In return, the operator pays the supplier a fee.</blockquote>


Online communities consist of two parts. The computer systems and the people that manage the communities. Managing communities is more of an art, and the tools are more of a science.

The more knowledgable and passionate a community manager is about their community, the better job they can do. They have to have the respect of the community to be effective.

The value of an online community is much higher than the cost of the tools to run it. That premium belongs to the people that manage the online community. Some community managers will learn to charge a high premium for their services, and other community managers will tend to price their service at cost, or even free.

Small online communities could be run in a few hours per week and generate pocket change. Larger groups would require more time and could generate a full time salary. Some entrepreneurs will figure out how to provide very high value for people, that is not easy to duplicate, and generate handsome profits.

The tools are going to standardize much more so than the community managers. Whatever option or feature a software system has is going to be copied much more readily than the activities of the community manager.

So there is a market to provide the tools for independent community managers. These tools would include a membership database and dues collection services. The prices would be established by the community manager, and they would keep all monies above the cost of the computer system.

In addition to tools, the software half of the business can provide training and best practices on how to run an online community. The price of the education would tend to be one time cost and used by all community managers.

The software half of the business is able to run large number of groups with relatively small variable costs. The community manager is going to be restrained in size by the number of hours in a day, and the number of fields that have some expertise in.

Therefore, there will be just a few software systems and tens of thousands of community managers. However, the software systems will be able to brand themselves, while the community managers will be word of mouth.

Are there any online communities you belong to that you would pay big bucks for ? Or is information destined to be free ?
