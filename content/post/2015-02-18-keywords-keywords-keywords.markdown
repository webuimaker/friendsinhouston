 A lot of marketing success on the Internet depends on how well you know the words that prospects will use when they try to find a product or service like yours.




If you are going to have any of your web page content appear in the first page of a Google search, you will need to convince Google that your page contains what people are looking for. That typically means having those exact words in your page title, in the opening paragraph, etc. And having a lot of trustworthy pages on the Internet link to you.




This is called Search Engine Optimization, and it's not easy to get a page ranked in the top ten pages in the world. And being on the second page does not count, because nobody ever scrolls to the second page of search engine results.




The other way to appear on the first page of Google is to pay them money by running an ad. Of course, your competitors are also willing to pay Google money, so this is also a very competitive area. And the way you advertise is by specifying the exact words and phrases that prospects will type into Google.




And knowing those exact words and phrases is a lot harder than it first seems. In my case, some of my best phrases have multiple meanings. I run Mailing Lists, but list brokers also sell mailing lists of snail mail addresses of doctors or accountants or almost any subset that you would want. And their are a lot more people looking for those type of mailing lists than an email discussion group. And the list brokers are also willing to pay Google more money than I am.




Listserv is a very good word for me, despite the fact that most people have never heard of it. Most of the people that are looking to transfer an email discussion group, are familiar with the term listserv. But email marketing companies like Mailchimp or Constant Contact are willing to pay money in hopes that the person was really looking to send out marketing messages.




And if I use a phrase like Listserv Hosting, then the web hosting companies are willing to pay money, in hopes that the person may be looking for their type of service. So lots of competition for just about any word or phrase that I use, and in my case, few of these ads are from my competitors.




So this weeks project is to try and find some new keywords and phrases that my prospects would be using in the search engines. I do know that many of the people that do find me, mention how hard I was to find. So let me see if I can change that even just a little bit.
