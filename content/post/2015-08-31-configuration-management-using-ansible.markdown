After about a year and a half of fairly constant work, I have migrated all of my server builds over to Ansible from my home grown server build tool. Yeah Team !




That means I can push a button and build any type of server that I need, and I can also apply changes to running systems very easily.




I have about 20 or 30 different types of servers, ranging from computers that take incoming email, to those that just deliver outgoing email, to those that are an actual listserv, not to mention web servers, monitoring servers and my actual Git and Ansible machine.




The sticking point for the past 6 months has been my main listserv machine, as it’s got a lot of functions and complexity in the build. Working through that step by step, while being able to migrate the existing data over to the new build has been time consuming.




But now that I’m done, I feel great ! I love Ansible.
