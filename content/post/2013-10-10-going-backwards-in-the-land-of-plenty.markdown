](/uploads/2013/12/going_backwards.jpeg)I came to Houston in 1980 in a 10 year old VW Beetle with about $10,000 in student loans and credit card debt.  33 years later, I don't even own a car and I have about $70,000 in credit card debt.

I’ve been living in Houston for 25 years now, and I like it. I never planned on moving to Houston. Growing up in Ohio, I was a California fan, and I did live in the San Francisco Bay Area for a couple of years. But I'm glad I ended up in Houston.

It's a big enough town that you can find most anything you want, yet spread out enough that it's rarely crowded. The people are friendly, it rarely snows, and the cost of living is low.

I like the lack of zoning, and certainly the area I live in is a big beneficiary of that live and let live attitude. When I moved to the Montrose in 1990, it was a war zone, with hundreds of abandoned houses, drag races on lower Westheimer, and gunfire ringing out many evenings.  Although I did buy a one bedroom condo out of foreclosure for $18,000 and I still use that as my office, so I really can't complain :-)

In most cities, areas like the Montrose are still going downhill, as the requirement that single family houses replace single family houses does not meet market reality. Here in the Montrose, the revival started around 1994, with two new 3 story houses going up where one decrepit single family bungalow was.  And it's continued like that for the past 20 years, although now we are tearing down perfectly fine bungalows :-(

And I like the "Can Do" business attitude here in Houston. While the rest of the country and the world is just starting to appreciate and encourage entrepreneurs, Houston has had many generations of extreme risk takers living here.

So it's certainly not Houston's fault that I'm still struggling to build a business, I've had every opportunity in the world. I'm doing something wrong :-)  Probably lots of things wrong, but my biggest mistake is trying to do everything myself.

Which is good up to a point, after which it becomes a big liability.

I’m ADD, an introvert, like to do lots of different things, love to learn new things and I think I can do them all well. Worst of all I’m a guy, and we hate to ask for directions, much less ask for meaningful help.

Part of the problem is that I never wanted any employees or commitments or responsibilities. I was after Freedom. In the beginning, mailing lists seemed to be a small enough problem that one person could do everything. But at some point the complexity and constant changes in the Internet over took my best efforts.

So I’m making a concerted effort to ask for help. And to follow the advice I get. Because I see lots of opportunity with online communities, but I can’t get there by myself.

So if you have any comments or suggestions, please leave a comment below.
