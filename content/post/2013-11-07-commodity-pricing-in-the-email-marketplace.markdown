](/uploads/2013/12/commodity_pricing.jpeg)Delivering email to groups of people should be a commodity. The quality depends on the inbox placement rate and speed of delivery (and only a few clients are monitoring these attributes). Once delivered, all emails look alike.

Because this is a new industry, the early leaders have been able to maintain a healthy profit margin, as they have been able to reduce costs, but not reduce prices. Yet.

That is, 10 or 15 years ago, it was much more expensive to deliver large quantities of email to groups of people. As computing power has increased, bandwidth costs have decreased, and new tools have been developed, the degree of difficulty and cost of sending email has plummeted. But the email delivery companies have been able to keep the price pretty much the same.

[Constant Contact](http://www.constantcontact.com) is the email marketing leader, and has the highest prices. Everybody else prices just below their numbers. Constant Contact does not see much benefit to reducing prices, because everybody else will just reduce their prices too.

The same for the much smaller discussion group niche, as [Lsoft](http://www.lsoft.com) is the 800 pound gorilla and has not reduced their prices as their costs have decreased. And everybody else is happy to price below their prices, as their costs are lower.

The third niche for delivering emails in bulk is transaction notifications. Emails telling individual people that their order has been received, their order has shipped, somebody has mentioned them on social media, etc.

At some point in time, the pricing is going to drop. For instance, Amazon has been delivering transactional email for a couple of years now. Their prices are very close to their costs, and Amazon is happy to keep reducing the prices as their costs decrease.

At the moment, Amazon delivers emails, but they really don't do email marketing, which is the reason why most businesses send out emails. And email marketing is a lot more complex than just delivering the email. Email marketing is not a commodity, and may never be a commodity. Some marketing is much more valuable than others, and the business is happy to pay for the value received.

The overall goal of email discussion groups is an online community where people can cooperate, collaborate, bond, build a knowledge base, etc. The value of those activities can be very high, and it's very challenging to get such groups established. So while delivering emails can be a critical part of an online community, it's not where most of the value is.

However, the delivery of transactional emails, where [Sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com), [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com), [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) and other companies compete, the value of sending an individual email is not much more than the cost of delivering the email.

So there is going to be a trend for email marketing and discussion group prices to drop towards the true costs of delivery the email, like in the transactional email marketplace.

I don't want to be in a commodity business, where the main competitive advantage is price. However, at the moment, my prices are 1/2 to 1/10 the prices of Lsoft. So I don't mind competing on price while I figure out how to capture more of the value of online communities. Because online communities are much more valuable than just delivering email.
