](/uploads/2013/12/paradigm_shift.jpeg)A [Paradigm Shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) is a change in the basic assumptions within the ruling theory of science.

[Virtual Communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Community) provide support, information, friendship and entertainment between strangers, around a common narrow topic, using social media networks. There are hundreds of thousands of active online communities, in most every imaginable niche, and the niches tend to be very focused and specific. Online communities tend to be winner takes all, as nobody wants to participate in the second best community for that niche.

This post asks the question whether a paradigm shift is happening in virtual communities.

The predominant form of online communities are Internet Message Boards, also called Web Forums. Other types include chat rooms, virtual worlds, mailing lists and social media, like Facebook and Twitter.

Note that chat rooms, virtual worlds and Twitter chats are synchronous, that is everybody must participate at the same time. The other platforms are asynchronous, allowing participation from people spread out over time.

Some types of platforms tend to use people's real names, like mailing lists, Facebook and LinkedIn Groups. Message Boards, chat rooms, and virtual worlds tend to use pseudonyms or alter egos.

Platforms can also be divided into "Push" or "Pull" types. Push puts each message in front of your face, while you need to travel to source for a Pull platform. Mailing lists are an example of a Push technology while Message Boards are a Pull type.

The Message Board is a web site, where messages are displayed, and grouped by topics. There are many different brands of message boards, many many different sites, and within each site, there can be many different sub topics.

These message boards are organized for supporting a sustained dialog on that narrow topic, and the messages posted are typically left online forever. So the web site can become an important resource for people wanting to learn about that particular topic. For example, [Karate Forums](http://www.karateforums.com) is a popular message board that has been around for 10 years and has had 500,000 messages posted over that time.

Message boards grew quickly starting in the late 1990's as they are cheap and easy to operate. By having people visit a web page, the technical difficulties of delivering email was avoided. In addition, people were not burdened with receiving emails on topics they were only mildly interested in.

There is a Life Cycle or different stages with Virtual Communities. They get started, typically with a small group of people, slowly develop an identity, build consistent activities and grow their membership, operate successfully for a period of time, and then start dying due to inactivity and people leaving, or the group splitting into more focused groups. Each stage can last for years, and some virtual communities are still active decades after they started.

Some of the variables that influence the stages are



	  * How often do they visit or participate
	  * How long are people staying
	  * Are they becoming more active over time
	  * How many questions get answered

The more a technical platform can make it easy for these types of activities, the better the chances of developing an active and long lasting virtual community.

You can put most any online community into one of the following types

	  * Community of Action
	  * Community of Circumstance
	  * Community of Interest
	  * Community of Practice
	  * Community of Place

The Hepatitis-B mailing list is a Community of Circumstance, and critical for Hepatitis-B patients and caregivers. The Clinical Nurse Specialist mailing list, is a Community of Practice, and very important to the all of it's members.

The Karate Forum is a Community of Interest, and on a message board. The vast majority of it's members do not visit in any given month.

The more important a community is, the more likely people want messages to be pushed to them. The less important, the more likely they don't want messages clogging up their inbox.

If you have a group with sporadic activity, it looks bad on a message board, because visitors see that there have been no messages in weeks or months. The lack of activity causes people to visit less often, and discourages them from posting messages.

While on a mailing list, nobody really notices or cares that a message has not arrived in a long time, as long as the messages that do come are relevant.

The ongoing shift to mobile has several implications. First of all, people now have the ability to easily convert down time into online community participation time. 5 minutes is frequently enough time to read all of the daily messages in an active community.

The small screen sizes of the mobile devices make it hard to navigate and read message boards, while plain text messages in email are easy to read. And email is one of the top activities people are already doing on their mobile devices.

There are some mobile apps that make it easier to read message boards than web browsers, but they either cost money or show ads, and sometimes both. And they only work with some message boards.

One of the unique features of Mail-List.com is "Mobile First" formatting, where incoming messages are converted to plain text, ads, disclaimers and long top post replies are removed, and attachments are converted to clickable links, creating small easy to read messages, perfect for small screens.

The migration to mobile devices is creating a situation where the most active online communities are going to use mailing lists. That is, for topics and niches that are highly relevant for somebody, their online community is going to come to them via email. The mailing lists allow easy passive participation on the small screen. Everybody knows how to use email, everybody checks their email all day long, while not everybody is going to buy a message board app, learn it or remember to check it.

However, getting people to migrate their online community from a message board to a mailing list is not going to happen very often. Successful online communities exist because it has become a habit for people to participate. Changing those habits from one platform to another is frequently enough to break those habits.

Instead, new online communities for a given niche are going to appear using mailing lists. Starting small they will establish enough value that over time individual members from the message boards will switch over to the new community.
