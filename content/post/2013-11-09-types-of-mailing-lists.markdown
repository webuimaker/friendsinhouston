[![types_mailing_lists](/uploads/2013/12/types_mailing_lists-300x81.jpeg)
](/uploads/2013/12/types_mailing_lists.jpeg)A listserv is a software application that allows somebody to send one email to a group of people transparently (per [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISTSERV)).

Email marketing companies like [Constant Contact](http://www.constantcontact.com), [Aweber](https://www.aweber.com), and [Vertical Response](http://www.verticalresponse.com), focus on creating good looking emails, with the ability to track results. That is, was the email opened, were any links in the email clicked, how did Subject Line A compare against Subject Line B.

Delivering the email into the inbox is a worthy goal, but not critical. Their customer is typically unsophisticated and has no way of knowing if all of their emails were received or not. The frequency of mailings is typically irregular, and the subscribers are not necessarily expecting to receive any particular email. Nor do they typically care if they get the silly marketing message or not, as their inbox is flooded with marketing spam.

The average Inbox Placement Rate for commercial Email Service Providers (ESP's) is below 80% according to [Return Path](http://landing.returnpath.com/placement-benchmarks-2013). The rest of the emails are accepted by the Internet Service Provider (ISP's) but either put in the Spam Folder, or simply lost on purpose. That is, the ISP is monitoring how much attention their customers are paying to emails from any particular source, and if they are never opened, the ISP will slow down or stop delivering new emails. Receiving too much unwanted email causes people to switch ISP's, thus they are proactive in keeping bad emails out.

The email being sent is usually created on the ESP's web site, using pre defined templates that are designed to look good in most any email reader, as there is no standard for HTML emails.

On the other hand, email discussion groups are focused on accepting emails from many different subscribers, using many different email readers, on their own computers or smartphones. No templates are involved.

Some of these messages are replies, which contain various fragments of the previous message, causing it's own set of formatting challenges.

Attachments can be included, and they present a delivery challenge, as ISP's are more likely to block the emails based on the large size or the possibility of containing a computer virus.

Delivering the email into the inbox is crucial, as most discussion groups have a regular rhythm and subscribers are expecting the messages. In addition, the subscribers know other members, and have private communication channels amongst themselves to check up on each other.

Mail-List.com runs it's own [Inbox Monitoring System](http://inbox-monitor.com/perl/summary?today), where the Inbox Placement Rate is above 99% for all ISP's except Yahoo. Yahoo is just plain inept.

Mail-List.com provides both Announcement Lists (Email Marketing) and Discussion Groups, although Announcement Lists are limited to plain text email. Thus most businesses are not interested, because they can't send out pretty emails, and there is no tracking. However, our prices are much lower than most Email Marketing companies, and plain text emails can be very useful for story tellers and other experienced marketing people, or situations where getting more than 80% of the messages into the inbox is important.

Mail-List.com has a couple of different types of clients. Some are small groups of 20 to 50 people, that just need to stay in touch by email. They are usually face to face groups that need to coordinate meetings, or share documents. Not much discussion goes on, and it's not a virtual community. They just need a simple to use system with reliable email delivery, and they don't want to pay much if anything for that service.

The second category is larger groups of several hundred to several thousand people, typically professionals in the same niche. These people either work for themselves or work at many different companies, and they seldom, if ever meet face to face. They are a virtual community and it's very valuable for the members, and they are willing pay for that value.

These types of professional membership organizations have existed for decades, and many of them have their own paid staff and headquarters. Others outsource the administration to Association Management Companies (AMC). There are several hundred AMC's with a few large ones having hundreds of employees.

These professional membership organizations provide specialized communications, education, political lobbying, and face to face events for their members. Dues might range from $50 to $500 for each member, although dues rarely fund the entire budget. There are thousands and thousands of these groups in the United States. Many are headquartered in Washington DC or state capitals.

Over the past 15 years, virtual communities have become important benefits for these associations. However, the typical association managers are not digital natives and the virtual communities are not a priority. Usually volunteers in the association have started and nurtured the communities.

Or the association has installed a message board system to provide an online community. These systems typically have a membership database, member profile pages, document and video repositories, in addition to a message board.

A relatively new trend is the all virtual professional membership organization. "Association Lite" I've seen them called. Some of these groups have no dues, no paid staff, and run their online communities on free services like Yahoo and Google Groups. Or use a message board at a web hosting company for less than $100 per year.

The volunteers that run these groups are digitally savvy, excellent networkers, and spend a fair chunk of time running their group as a hobby.

If the free online communities ever compete in the same exact niche as a dues paying association, the professional associations had better watch out. For most professionals, the value these days is in the online community, not annual conferences that they don't have the time or money to attend.

And nobody has time to participate in the second best online community in their niche.
