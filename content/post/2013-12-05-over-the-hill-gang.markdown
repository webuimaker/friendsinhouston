I'm looking for some very talented programmer types that have retired, yet are looking for some new challenges.




We are going to build a scalable listserv, in multiple clouds, with extreme reliability, using best practices, that can operate so inexpensively, that nobody will need to put up with the privacy stealing, ad spewing ways of the "Free" Google and Yahoo Groups.




It's going to use cloud patterns like self-provisioning, auto-scaling, message queues, multiple regions and more, to deliver old fashioned email. Using modern languages like [Python](http://www.python.org),[ AWS-CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).




I'm figuring that retired people don't need a paycheck, and may be willing to work for startup equity or a franchise territory. Us older people have a wealth of experience in building systems, that can be adapted to the new technologies.




And I'm just not sure I can cope with Gen Y. I've been isolated for so long that I don't have any direct experience with people in their 20's. I know that the stereotypes I read about don't apply to everybody. And I know that being a digital native has awesome advantages over my generation, that never saw a computer until we were at least 20 years old.




But still, I would prefer to steer clear of working with the young'uns, as patience is not my long suit.




At the moment, I need help with these projects





  * Centralizing all the logs from every server using [Logstash](http://logstash.net).
  * Replacing my home grown Configuration Management system with something like [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com), [Chef](http://www.opscode.com), [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com) or [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com).
  * Billing and micro-payments processing. [Stripe](https://stripe.com) seems to be the leader in this area at the moment.



While I have more than a working prototype of a mailing list system at the moment, I would expect most parts are going to need to be rewritten to scale up to running tens of thousands of mailing lists.




I'm not looking for people with experience in these tools. I'm looking for people that want to dive in and learn these tools, and then implement them. And take what they learned, and implement them again, in a more robust flexible way. And stay responsible for that subsystem for many years to come. With test suites and solid documentation in case they get run over by a bus. Or they start having "senior" moments :-)




I am looking for A players, people that are self starters, and can work on their own. People that don't want a boss, and only want to work along side other A players. I'm willing to spin out clients that pay you directly, so in effect you are running your own hamburger stand. Just sharing a code base with other hamburger stand owners, who also happen to be ace techies.




Probably 4 to 6 hours a day, 4 to 6 days a weeks, at least 30 weeks a year, for the foreseeable future. Email is not dead yet.




So if those sound like the sort of challenges you would like to dig into, and you are flexible in how you get compensated for your results, let's chat on the phone or over a cup of coffee. Maybe leave a comment below or [contact me via this form](http://www.mail-list.com/contact-us/), or just dial 713-520-4500 right now.
