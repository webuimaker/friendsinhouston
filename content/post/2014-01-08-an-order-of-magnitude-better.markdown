](/uploads/2014/01/order_of_magnitude.jpeg)A common viewpoint amongst venture capital people, is that a newcomer into an existing industry must be 10 times better than the entrenched incumbent to succeed.

[Ben Horowitz](http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2013/01/21/investing-in-crazy-ideas-for-tiny-markets/), of Andreessen Horowitz says


<blockquote>The key thing is the idea has to be a breakthrough,” he said. “When you are talking about technology it means literally a much better way of doing things. To make money it really has to be an order of magnitude better. The problem with breakthroughs is they look insane. If it didn’t seem crazy, it wouldn’t be a breakthrough because everybody else would already have solved that problem.</blockquote>


The incumbent in the listserv business is Lsoft. While Mail-List.com has many unique features, I'm not sure the typical Lsoft customer really cares about any of them. I'm not even sure if my price was one tenth of their current cost, if that would be enough of a motivation to switch suppliers.

That's because any cost savings for the company or university does not go into the pockets of the people making the decision. However, if there were any repercussions from a switch, then their reputations and possibly even their career would be negatively impacted.

[Matthew Griffin](http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2013/04/01/how-to-unseat-the-incumbent/) shares some perspectives of building companies from scratch on his blog.


<blockquote>Sales teams within many organisations typically start their campaigns by trying to broker tactical sales engagements. While this approach helps you build your short and medium term pipelines it’s the strategic engagements which will earn you a seat at the customers board room table and catapult you to long term corporate success. Becoming truly strategic to an organisation though means you have to take an entirely different type of message to an entirely different audience – the fabled C Suite.</blockquote>


One of the strategic differences between our products is that Mail-List.com runs in the Amazon cloud. Getting software out of their in-house data center, and into the cloud may be something that the C Suite sees as strategic and desirable.

There are going to be many people and many departments involved in making any decision to replace an existing product. The IT department, the Purchasing department, and even the Executive team. So it's going to take a long time to convince all of those people to make the decision. And I'm not going to be able to fool anybody with smoke and mirrors, they have to be legitimate advantages with verifiable proof.

It would be nice to have tactical benefits that appeal to the operations team that is running the current product, as well as strategic benefits that appeal to high level management. And the new product must not remove features or make things harder for the end users either. A typical Lsoft installation at a university probably runs 1,000 or more mailing lists.

Switching out listserve software is not a big technical problem. Exporting and importing lists of email addresses and mail archives is simple and quick enough. Getting lots of users trained in using a new system is another matter though.

So while I understand many of the problems and pain points of my existing clients, I don't know much about the problems that universities face in running Lsoft's product. My customers tend to run just one or two mailing lists, while a university is running thousands of lists. So the next step is to conduct some research and see what I can learn.

Do you know anybody currently running an Lsoft installation that I can talk to ?
