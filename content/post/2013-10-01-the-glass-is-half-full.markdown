](/uploads/2013/12/glass_half_full.jpg)In 1995, at the dawn of the age of the Internet, I was looking for a business to start. Or rather I was looking for a way of piddling around with computers and not having a boss, and a business seemed like a good alternative to my previous 15 years of working in the corporate world.

And the business that attracted my attention was to run mailing lists for special interest groups. My main thought was that it was a software system that could be improved upon on a regular basis, until the system was so robust that it worked well without any support.

The second thing that appealed to me was that it would be a recurring revenue stream, as once a mailing list was running, it would keep running for years to come. And I really like the idea of helping people communicate in special interest groups, where everybody shares the same passion.

18 years later, I finally have a software system that runs pretty smoothly, and my clients rarely need me. In fact, after years of things blowing up on a daily basis, it’s a tad boring.

Now you can create your own mailing list system by putting email addresses in the CC: field, and having everybody hit Reply All. So how did it take 18 years for me to build a mailing list system ?

I’m trying to figure that out.

All of my main tools are open source software, which are quite robust and available for free. Including Smartlist which is a mailing list manager, that is at the core of my system.

So 18 years does seem a tad long for building a mailing list system.

Along the way, I’ve had the opportunity to



	  * Teach myself everything from Linux to Google Adwords, from Accounting to the Cloud.
	  * Work by myself.
	  * Work at my own pace, without any external pressures.
	  * Enjoy coming to work each and every day, without ever getting burned out.
	  * Not having anything on my calendar. No meetings, no conferences, no nothing.
	  * Help other people build online communities that help people to cooperate and collaborate, and have a joyful experience with people that are like them.
