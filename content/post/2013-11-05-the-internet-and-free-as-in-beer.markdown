](/uploads/2013/12/free_beer.jpeg)Some time in 1997, one of my customers told me they were leaving my paid service and moving to Coollist, because Coollist was free. And Coollist was going to make it's money by putting advertisements in the emails.

That was a real wake up call, as I could see that most people would prefer free, and are willing to trade their subscriber's data and pollute the emails with ads in exchange for not paying any money.

Since that time, the free Internet services has dominated email and many other aspects of the Internet. Not only can you get free email with basically unlimited strorage, you can run free email discussion groups at Yahoo, Google and MSN.

There are many new Internet services that are free to use, but have significant expenses for employees and server costs. These costs are being paid for by venture capital firms, in the hopes that the company will attract enough eyeballs and that a way of monetizing those eyeballs will be found before the money runs out.

Advertising is the most common way of making money, and [Yahoo](http://groups.yahoo.com), [Google](http://groups.google.com) and [MSN Groups](http://groups.msn.com) are probably making more money per subscriber than I am, by collecting demographic data and showing ads. However, I'm not sure that is going to last.

For starters, the value of ads on the Internet continues to decline year after year. There are more places to show ads than there are companies willing to pay for ads. There is a constant increase in content on the Internet, while the number of eyeballs that can afford to buy the products advertised remains about the same.

And those eyeballs are not paying as much attention to ads as in the past. There has been a steady decline in click through rates and engagement of ads, year after year. The term "banner blindness" describes part of the problem.

The value of the demographic data is also declining because there are now many sources of this type of data. Almost every move made by every person on the Internet is tracked, stored, and matched up with other data so complete profiles exist at many different companies.

The trend to mobile is causing problems because there the limited space hinders the placement of ads. Mobile is typically used by people multitasking, and they have even less inclination to click on an ad when they are using their smartphone.

One example of a free service that was recently shut down is [Google Reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader). Literally everybody used that service to manage their RSS feeds because their free service squeezed out all competitors over the past 7 years. The Google Reader service was mature and did not require any engineering manpower. The bandwidth and storage requirements were minimal. The demographic data was unique, because Google knew every single blog you followed, what articles your read, and what articles you started, but did not finish.

Yet Google choose to tick off tens of thousands of influential people and shut down the service because they said it did not mesh with their vision. Many of those people would have paid for the service if given a chance.

Other examples of excellent free products that have been shut down include the [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com/) blogging service and [Delicious](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/delicious-shutting-down) bookmarking service.

These companies are no obligation to provide free services, but when you see popular, mature services shutting down, you have to wonder why, and if that trend is going to increase.

you're the product being sold."

These days, some people are starting to understand the drawbacks with the lack of privacy, and are willing to pay for to keep their discussions as private as possible. Other groups need technical support from time to time, and none of the free services ever offer support.

Some groups spend more paid staff time guiding new members through enrollment in the free services than it would cost for a paid service. Other groups are starting to realize that they would have more participation in their community if their emails came to the primary email addresses of their members, and not the Yahoo or Gmail address they set up simply to get on. And other people have lived with the free services long enough to know that you get what you pay for, and it's just not worth it anymore.

I think the free Internet services have peaked and are going to slowly decline over the next few years. Any type of stock market drop or reduction in exit strategies for startups will simply accelerate the trend from free to paid.

Are you willing to pay for some of the services you use, all of the services you use, or none of the services you use ?
