](/uploads/2013/12/innovation.jpeg)Is email dead ? I don't think so, I think its more important than ever.

Is email new and sexy ? No.

Do people feel stressed out and over burdened with the amount and types of emails they get ? Absolutely.

Are there possible improvements in email discussion groups to help foster online communities ? I think so, but so far, I don't have much to show for my innovations.

First of all, let's look at the unique features that Mail-List.com has already implemented.



	  * Clickable Attachments
	  * Inbox Monitoring
	  * 1 Question Survey
	  * Self Serve Delivery Logs
	  * Mobile First Formatting
	  * Crowdsource KnowledgeBase
	  * Throttling, instead of Bouncing
	  * Disappearing Ink
	  * SMS/MMS Text Messages
	  * Bounce Re-Delivery System

Some of those features were created to solve recurring problems that impacted the mailing list owners. Other features I invented myself with very little input from my users, because I like to build stuff :-)

One thing I have learned is that all features must be an option, because no matter how great I think it is, somebody does not want it.

It's frustrating to me when people turn off features that I think they should be using. The Mobile First Formatting is a prime example. It does a good job of making the emails compact and easy to read, and perfect for mobile phones. But it does this by converting HTML email into plain text email first. And many people like HTML email, especially the decision makers of a mailing list.

They want to have bold text, and seeing their logos and pictures in the signature seems to be important for their egos. But I think it adds friction to their lists and reduces participation, thus hurting their online community.

Another example is the Crowdsource KnowledgeBase feature that allows groups to tag and like emails. This will build a permanent repository of their most valuable posts. A couple of clicks and members can vote up the best messages, or group their emails into categories. Very sophisticated programming, very minimal usage.

If I was running some of these large online communities, I would get a handful of volunteers to be curators, and start organizing this very valuable stream of information that is flowing by.

In some cases, the executive directors are Pre-Computer/Pre-Internet and they don't have any interest nor training with online communities. They see it as technology and computer stuff, and they have a strong distaste for both, and wish it would just go away.

The[ Lean Startup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup) and Minimum Viable Product movements of today address the problem of creating features that your paying customers don't see value in. While these movements have just gained traction in the past couple of years, I certainly have enough IT experience and history to know better than building features that users don't want.

Besides liking to build stuff, I felt I needed some unique features to distinguish myself from other mailing list providers. And to compete with message boards, which also host online communities through a slightly different platform.

Features like Clickable Attachments, Inbox Monitoring, Throttling instead of Bouncing, Self Serve Delivery Logs and the Bounce Re-Delivery System are all focused on delivering the email into the subscriber's inbox. This is a critical element of mailing lists and any deficiencies in this area are noticed and held against you. Just these features alone are unique amongst mailing list hosts, and enough to make a difference in any competitive bakeoff.

The other key feature at Mail-List.com is superior support. I'm fast to respond, I can solve almost any problem immediately, and I can usually keep the problem from happening again with either some custom programming or documentation. And my clients do notice that and appreciate it.

So in hindsight, I was done programming Mail-List.com a few years ago, for the vast majority of potential clients, and I should have started growing the business at that time.

Although I'm really glad to have all the other features, and it may be with some education and training, they will become valuable assets for active online communities.
