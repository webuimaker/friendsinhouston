](/uploads/2013/12/boundaries.jpeg)One of the topics that the book "[Double Double: How to Double Your Revenue and Profit in 3 Years or Less](http://www.amazon.com/Double-Your-Revenue-Profit-Years-ebook/dp/B0097K9FRI/ref=sr_1_1)" by Cameron Herold explores is the notion of boundaries. What am I willing to do, and what won't I do.

So as I'm envisioning the potential future of Mail-List.com, what am I willing to give up ?

If this company is to have more people, how will they get paid. As an employee, or as an owner, or as a franchisee, or some other way?

Am I going to retain control of the company, or should I sell it to somebody that has the resources to grow it quickly?

Do I want/need to work 60 hours a week? Some of my best memories are when I was working long hours on a project with a challenging deadline.

What will I do when I work?

I'm not going to do any more programming. I do very little programming now, RG II does all the program design and coding.

I do like to design and build and assemble pieces into a system. I'm not exactly sure how to rate myself on these skills. I think I'm pretty good, but I don't think it's my unique ability.

Should I be in marketing and sales? I don't think anybody that joins Mail-List.com is going to have the same passion for building online communities as I do. And they probably won't know as much about the field as I do.

I could probably be pretty good in sales strictly on my passion. Although I certainly do not have any sales experience, and tend to think poorly of salesman.

Should I be the president and coordinate people in marketing, operations and finance?

Or should I be the visionary, and pick the always changing path that is needed in this dynamic world.

What I could do very well, is run the help desk, and make sure clients have a great experience. I wonder if I could be president and visionary while running the support department? Looking at things from the client's point of view, and getting everybody aligned towards the same goal. Using the feedback from the clients to direct the future path.

Anybody want to chime in and give me some direction here ? Please add your free advice below.
