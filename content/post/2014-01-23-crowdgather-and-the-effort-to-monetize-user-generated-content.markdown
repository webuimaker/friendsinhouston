](/uploads/2014/01/crowdgather.jpeg)[CrowdGather](http://www.crowdgather.com) is a public company that has received several million dollars of venture capital during the past 5 years. CrowdGather owns and operates several online message forums software packages, and works to monetize forum communities with an advertising network.

It operates some forums itself, although the bulk of it's revenue of approximately $2 million dollars per year is from third party forum owners.

CrowdGather reduced it's burn rate to approximately $60,000 per month in a recent restructuring. They are hoping for momentum to return to the online advertising marketplace, when they will be able to approach breakeven.

The above is from their [press release](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130724005445/en/CrowdGather-Announces-2013-Year-Results-Update-Corporate#.UuEEJP16j-k) of July 24, 2013.

Personally, I think any momentum in online advertising is going to continue to be downward in pricing, and the shift to the small screen sizes of mobile devices will reduce the opportunity to insert ads.

And navigating online forums with a mobile device is frustrating and will lead to decreased participation. There are some apps that provide a better user experience to online forums, however they these apps have their own set of drawbacks.

CrowdGather can overcome the decrease in revenue on each ad shown, by increasing the number of forums they run advertising for. Â But the decline in revenue for any particular forum will discourage forum owners from even bothering to run ads, as the results will not be worth it.

The dream of being able to monetize user generated content, in narrow niches, by selling ads is going to remain just that, a dream. And that will affect not only CrowdGather, but many other companies that have been built because it looks so easy to offer useful services for free.
