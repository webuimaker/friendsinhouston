In many online based businesses of today, the "product" is created by the users working together, on a platform the business has built. So Youtube is different from your local TV channel, even though you can watch shows for free in either place. The TV channel pays for most of the content they broadcast, while people give Youtube the content that it streams. They both make money from advertising.

So a platform business must cater to both the creators of the content and the consumers of that content. There is no value without both. The product of a platform business is not the software and systems, but rather the content and community that users create and consume, using that software system.

Pricing access at zero encourages consumption, and removes a big barrier for people to participate. The number of participants on a platform is a key indicator of the value, although exactly how that value is going to be distributed to all the participants is frequently messy.

Yahoo and Google Groups provide a free communications platform for special interest groups, and make money from advertising. Mail-List.com provides a paid communications platform for special interest groups, and does not put in any advertising. Many special interest groups do not have any dues or fees, no treasurer or bank account, and thus no easy way to pay for a service. Free is a perfect solution for them, and overrides any concerns with privacy, ease of use or support.

Curation is a key tool in most online platforms, so that the best material can be found. The platform allows people to add comments or vote up the best content. Or to rate other users so that trust can be established.

A typical mailing list does not really have any curation, so the number of email messages in a day must be a reasonable number, or people will unsubscribe. Each member of the mailing list must curate their own output, so they don't send a lot of noise to everybody else.

A typical mailing list does not have any mechanism for rating their members. Each individual has their own trust process, based on previous messages from that member, or perhaps offline contact.

Many message board communities try to provide an indicator of trust, by having a badge for different levels of users. Although typically the level is based on the number of messages posted, which is not necessarily the same as quality of messages.

Mail-List.com is the first mailing list with a curation process, where members can vote up or tag every message with a couple clicks of the mouse. This allows another level of membership to people who don't have time for all the messages of a group, to just see the best messages. Or the messages in one particular sub-niche.

Content is the currency on a platform. Youtube creators make a video and upload it. Most large active mailing lists are people asking questions, and their colleagues answering those questions. Sometimes the answers are a link to a resource or an existing document. Other answers are custom created for that exact unique question.

Old content is also valuable. Youtube has millions of videos available. Most mailing lists have a searchable web archive, where people can research previous messages by keywords or author. Many times their question has already been answered.

Creating content takes time and effort, and any improvements in the process can generate more content. The rise of cheap video cameras and smartphones has allowed millions of times more videos to be created today than 10 years ago. I wonder if speech recognition on a smartphone is going to allow people to compose text answers to a mailing list faster. Or maybe the email will just contain the audio.

Any improvements I can make that allows for easier and better content, make Mail-List.com a more valuable service. Mailing lists are an example of an early platform, and the value of the mailing list is dependent upon the content and interactions that the users create.

And the topic must be about something highly relevant to the members, as we all have limited time and attention. There are hundreds of thousands of online communities, but most people are only active in one group at the most.

A tip of the hat to Sangeet Paul Choudary at [Platform Thinking](http://platformed.info).

Got any suggestions on how to make a mailing list a better platform ?
