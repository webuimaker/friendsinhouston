](/uploads/2013/12/strengths_finder.jpg)StrengthsFinder 2.0](http://www.strengthsfinder.com) is both a book and a test designed to identify the strengths of a person. They identify 34 different attributes that everybody shares, and try to name your strongest areas.

The book suggests that you focus on working with your strengths, not your weaknesses.

When you buy the book, you get password to take the test online. So don't buy a used book, as that password will have already been used.

I took the test in 2011 and my results were

	  1. Ideation
	  2. Input
	  3. Individualization
	  4. Command
	  5. Learner

They have a chapter in their book on each of these attributes, and here is a snippet of what they say.


<blockquote>Ideation - You are fascinated by ideas. An idea is a concept, the best explanation of the most events. You are delighted when you discover beneath the complex surface an elegantly simple concept to explain why things are the way they are. An idea is a connection. Yours is the kind of mind that is always looking for connections, and so you are intrigued when seemingly disparate phenomena can be linked by an obscure connection.</blockquote>


Partner with someone with strong Analytical talents.


<blockquote>Input - You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information - words, facts, books and quotations - or you might collect tangible objects such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs. Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It's interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove valuable.</blockquote>


Partner with someone with dominant Focus or Discipline talents.


<blockquote>Individualization - Your Individualization theme leads you to be intriqued by the unique qualities of each person. You are impatient with generalizations or "types" because you don't want to obscure what is special and distinct about each person. Instead, you focus on the differences between individuals. You instinctively observe each person's style, each person's motivation, how each thinks, and how each builds relationships. Because you are such a keen observer of other people's strengths, you can draw out the best in each person. This Individualization theme also helps you build productive teams.</blockquote>


Who to partner with is not specified.


<blockquote>Command - leads you to take charge. Unlike some people, you feel no discomfort with imposing your views on others. Whereas others may avoid facing up to life's unpleasantness, you feel compelled to present the facts or truths, no matter how unpleasant it may be. People are drawn toward those who take a stance and ask them to move in a certain direction. Therefore people will be drawn to you.</blockquote>


Partner with someone with strong Woo or Empathy talents.


<blockquote>Learner - You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, you will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you. You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence. This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the subject matter expert, or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less significant than the "getting there".</blockquote>

Tests like StrengthsFinder are sort of like horoscopes in that you could probably pick any 5 categories at random, and think that they apply to you.

Have you ever taken the StrengthsFinder, and if so, what did you think of their results ?
