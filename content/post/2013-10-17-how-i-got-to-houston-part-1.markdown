There were not too many personal computers around when I moved to California in 1978. There were a handful of stores that sold computers and a lot of the personal computers sold were kits that you soldered together yourself. The microprocessors were slow, memory was expensive, and hard disks cost tens of thousands of dollars. So the first storage devices for microcomputers were made using cassette tape decks.

There was no software for these new computers, so they did not do anything useful. It was mainly hobbyists that bought them, and getting them to play crude tones and "music" through a small cheap speaker was an early highlight.

I moved to San Francisco with a college degree and a year of Cobol programming experience to work for Arthur Andersen & Company. They were primarily an auditing and tax firm, with a division that did software systems for large companies. That division spun out to become Accenture about 20 years later.

Despite AA & Co being a custom software development specialist, and despite having several hundred employees, I was the only one interested in personal computers. Actually, I was about the only person interested in software or computers at all, as most everybody else wanted to be a consultant. And being at AA & Co was a good stepping stone for them.

It was a good stepping stone for me too, as it enabled me to become an independent contract programmer for large mainframe companies. Independent contract programmers were just starting to happen, and it let me focus on the technical aspects of a job, without having to play any corporate politics. It gave me a bigger paycheck, and most importantly, a good excuse to take time off at the end of each project.

I bought my first computer in the spring of 1979, at the West Coast Computer Faire in Silicon Valley. It was a large trade show with maybe a hundred different small vendors, and I remember Jim Warren, the organizer skating around the floor trying to hold the show together.

The computer I bought was a bag of parts and two motherboards. One board for the microprocessor and the other board for 4K of ram. Both boards about 6 inches square. And a friend I had met working in Stockton was the only reason I had the gumption to try to build my own computer. Basil was an electrical engineer, and had built one of the first Altair computers several years before.

So with Basil's help and a few months of soldering capacitors, resistors and the occasional integrated circuit, I had a working computer. Where "working" is used very loosely, because it did not do anything. My keypad was just hexadecimal numbers, the output was 6 jumbo LED's and there was no way to attach any storage or printers.

Flush with my hardware success, I wrote a cross assembler. This had no commercial value, but it gave me a good excuse to dive deep into the architecture of both the 8080 chip, and my computer's chip, the 1802.

Around this time, I got a good friend of mine from college interested in building his own computer. He bought the same computer kit, and got it working too. And Joe had ended up in Houston programming for Gulf Oil. So I came to visit him in the fall of 1980, and we had a grand time trying to figure out the mysteries of these gadgets.

After a month of sleeping on his couch, I decided to stay in Houston and finding a job was easy. If you could spell IBM at that time, companies were dying to hire you. I had two offers on my first day of looking for a job!

I stayed to Houston because I was intensely interested in microprocessors and personal computers, and Joe was the only other person I knew that was as intense as I was.

The weird thing is I moved here from Silicon Valley.

Did anybody ever move to Houston for a reason other than a job ?
