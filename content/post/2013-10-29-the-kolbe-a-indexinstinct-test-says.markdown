](/uploads/2013/12/kolbe.png)The [Kolbe A Test](http://www.kolbe.com) tries to measure our instinctual behaviors, instead of our personality or intelligence. That is, what is our Method of Operation. The test is a couple of dozen multiple choice questions, takes about 20 minutes and costs $50.

The result is a score from one to ten in 4 different categories. Their continuum says that the low numbers orient towards preventing problems, while the high numbers tend to initiating solutions.

And some insight to what those scores mean. The 4 categories are



	  * Fact Finder: is how you gather and share information
	  * Follow Thru: is how you arrange and design
	  * Quick Start: is how you deal with risks and uncertainty
	  * Implementor: is how you handle space and tangibles, abstract vs concrete

Usually you have one category that is dominant, with the highest score. The higher your score, the more likely you are to operate in that way. The lower your score, the more likely you are to resist operating in that way.

My Kolbe A Index scores are

	  * Fact Finder = 6
	  * Follow Thru = 3
	  * Quick Start = 8
	  * Implementor = 3

In the accompanying personalized summary, Kolbe says


<blockquote>Your Kolbe A Index result shows you are terrific at juggling rapidly changing priorities, which makes you flexible with a practical bent. That's because you temper your trial-and-error approach by calculating probabilities.</blockquote>


The Kolbe A Index says I have a natural strength in each Action Mode that helps me make better decisions. And mine is



	  * Fact Finder: Your best way of gathering/sharing information is by Explaining.
	  * Follow Thru: Your best way of arranging/designing is by Adapting.
	  * QuickStart: Your best way of dealing with risks/uncertainty is by Improvising.
	  * Implementor: Your best way of handling space/tangibles is by Imagining.

The Kolbe test predicts that I've probably been asked this question before.


<blockquote>Why don't you stay focused?
Why don't you just stick with the plan?</blockquote>


and says that actually, that is a strength of mine, and I need to look at it like this.


<blockquote>I prevent getting boxed in by staying open to alternatives.
My ability to adapt my plans helps my take advantage of opportunities.</blockquote>


So there :-)

Another way of looking at these categories for me is that I -



	  * Fact Finder: Get essential facts.
	  * Follow Thru: Develop shortcuts and multitask.
	  * QuickStart: Experiment to see what will happen.
	  * Implementor: Picture how things could work.

Another way of looking at this score, is the percentage of conative or mental energy I spend when in my most productive state.

	  * Fact Finder: 30% - deals with the PAST
	  * Follow Thru: 15% - involves PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE
	  * QuickStart: 40% - targets the FUTURE
	  * Implementor: 15% - deals with the HERE-AND-NOW

The Kolbe A prescription for me says

	  * give yourself a deadline, guess if you must, and decide to beat the odds.
	  * skip from one thing to the next without finishing what you start.
	  * find out what information others need from you during the day–and get it moving.
	  * You're likely to procrastinate if you have to follow a highly structured format or system.
	  * When you need to be persuasive in an unfamiliar situation, wing it. Trust your guts to pull out the right examples and call it as you see it. You'll be right on target.
	  * You may create clutter, which is fine for you because it results from the diversity of communiqués around you at any one time. Be brief, spontaneous, but thorough. Don't let efficiency experts try to change you. Orderliness is among the least of your priorities, but communicate an appreciation of it in others.
	  * You work well against deadlines; in fact, you need them in order to call a halt to your information gathering. You make decisions for the future without paying a lot of attention to the here-and-now. Others may believe you expect the impossible, so use your powers of persuasion to promote your own talent for getting things done.

The best use of the Kolbe A Index may be in assembling teams of people, where you get people with different instincts on the same team so the team has a good mix of all four ways of solving a problem.

Have you ever taken the Kolbe test or had any experience in applying it to teams of people ?
