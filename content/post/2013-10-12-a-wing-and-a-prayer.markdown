](/uploads/2013/12/wing+prayer.jpeg)I've never done any market research or cost analysis on my business, so it's little wonder that I've been struggling and bleeding cash for 18 years now.

On the other hand, if I had known what I was getting into, I would have stayed being a contract programmer.

I think most small businesses are started strictly on passion, and ignorance of the realities of the marketplace and overconfidence in your abilities are necessities.

Sometimes I watch [Restaurant Impossible](http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurant-impossible/index.html), where Robert Irvine tries to help restaurants on the verge of collapse, and I really identify with the show's participants. They start restaurants for silly reasons, are severely undercapitalized, have borrowed money from friends and families, are not taking a salary, pick poor locations, have no portion controls, dish out lousy food, do not know what their costs are, and then they wonder why their restaurant is failing.

There are just too many different skills and aptitudesÂ to starting a new business, that it is implausible for one person to have them all. And while having a partner with some complimentary skills would be a blessing, it's almost impossible to find an honest person willing to jump into the fire the same time you are.

For me, numbers and analytics are not my cup of tea. I've never bothered to look at my costs because the marginal cost of adding a new customer is very low. My feeling is that I simply need more customers, and that I've always been close to the tipping point, where 90% of each new sale falls to the bottom line.

Higher prices would definitely help, but I've not been able to find many people that want to pay me more money. So maybe that is a marketing and sales problem, and if I was better in those categories, I would have more success.

On the other hand, my software system barely worked for most of the last 18 years, and being better at marketing and sales during that time would probably have driven me out of business, as my unhappy customers would spread the word.

As it was, with a small trickle of new customers, I was able to give everybody lots of personal attention, and patch up bugs and fill gaps as I went along. In fact, I developed some of my best relationships with people who's mailing list I screwed up the most times. Sometimes their mail did not go out, or it went out to only some of the people on the list. Sometimes I truncated too much of their emails, and on occasion I sent out blank emails. Sometimes my system was not adding new subscribers, and sometimes it was removing them for no reason at all.

I've been down for so long that it looks like up to me :-) So I'm looking forward to this next phase, where I have a working system, and I'm going to be switching from the micro view to the macro view, and seeing if I can't grow this business with the help of some people with complimentary skills.

Do you know anybody that took an analytic approach to starting a new business, and if so, did it work ? Please leave that story below.
