While I need some good programmers and system administrators, there are some more pressing needs. Sales for instance. Incoming money is a good thing to have. And it just shows how unrealistic I am, that I think of recruiting techie people first.




On the other hand, it's going to be difficult to sell a big ticket item backed up by one person.




While my long term goal is to be able to run listserv's very cheaply, my initial goal is to sell big installations for a big check. Although it would be a smaller check than they are currently writing, for a better product.




Sales and marketing covers a lot of territory, and the Internet is just adding new functions and complexity. Having a web site that looks like it was created in the last decade is a must. Participation in social media is expected. Good sales copy and sales funnels are a necessity. Auto responder sequences via email are key. Search engine optimization can bring in a lot of people that are actively looking to solve their problem.




But to sell big ticket items requires sales people that can build relationships with the right people at the right companies. To find out what their real needs are and who makes the decisions. These people already are using a product that meets their needs, and have been using the same product for the past 20 years or so. It's not going to be easy or quick to sell a competing solution, even if it is better and cheaper, because people's careers are on the line.




Again, I'm looking for old timers that are flexible with their compensation. People that are interested in learning new things, as we did not grow up with social media or search engine optimization. Nor did we grow up with out sourcing marketplaces like [Odesk](https://www.odesk.com) or [Fiverr](http://fiverr.com).




For things like web design or search engine optimization, it's probably best to outsource as much as possible, because there are lots of very talented people, with specializations in very specific areas that are working in low cost countries. You just need to know what you want, and kiss a few frogs before you find the prince/princess that delivers.




Designing sales funnels and writing sales copy is more of an American thing, because there are lots of nuances in marketing that just can't be grokked coming from a different culture.




For selling B2B to large institutions, mainly universities, previous experience in selling big ticket software products would be golden.




Are there any ex IBM or BMC people out there looking for a challenge ?
