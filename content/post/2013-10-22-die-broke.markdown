](/uploads/2013/12/die_broke.jpeg)I read the book "[Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan](http://www.amazon.com/Die-Broke-Radical-Four-Part-Financial/dp/0887309429/ref=sr_1_1)" by Stephen Pollan and Mark Levine a number of years ago, and it really resonated with me. They say



	  1. Quit Your Job, be an independent contractor and make sure you do what you like.
	  2. Pay Cash and spend it wisely.
	  3. Don't Retire, keep doing what you love doing and get better at it.
	  4. Die Broke.

Those are some radical ideas for the boomer generation, as our parents did things very differently. A steady job was the centerpiece of my parent's world view. They grew up in the Great Depression, and jobs were very hard to come by. And you did not have food stamps and welfare in those days, so you just went hungry.

And a good job not only paid you while you worked, it paid you to retire starting at age 65. Until you died.

That plan started falling apart as my generation entered the work force. The corporations stopped their life time employment and merged and downsized at a fierce pace. And stopped having retirement plans, and instead might make small contributions to your personal retirement account.

About the only exception is if you went to work for the government. And I have just have too much spirit and energy to waste my life working at a government job.

The microcomputer has been the liberating force for entrepreneurial minded people for the past 30 years. If you had some technical skills, you could focus the power of the cheap computer on a problem, and blow away any existing solution.

And while I flunked Computer Science 102 twice in college, I was like a one eyed man in the land of the blind. Most of my generation had a strong disdain for computers and the changes they caused. They did not want to learn new skills, and they thought by ignoring the computer it would go away. They thought it was cool to say, I'm not "computer literate".

Kids growing up in the 80's and 90's might have had a computer by the time they were 5 or 10 years old. Kids growing up now have an iPhone or iPad from the time they are 2 years old. And these digital natives are much more fluent in the languages and applications than I ever could be. Now I'm a one eyed man in a land where the young people have 3 or 4 eyes.

I am too curious and have too much energy to like the concept of retirement. Golf courses and cruise ships don't appeal to me at all. And saving up several million dollars to retire on seemed impossible. So it was nice to find a book that took that viewpoint and made it part of the strategy.

I recently attended my high school's 40th reunion and was surprised to learn that several of my classmates are retired. My first reaction was jealousy and envy, followed by shame. I was at the top of my high school class, so I don't have any excuses.

On the other hand, they have gone to work everyday, at a job they probably did not like, and I just worked at things I liked, with plenty of time off between gigs.

And I'm not sure the couple of million of dollars they saved up is as valuable as an entrepreneurial mindset and skillset. Should the stock market crash, or the banks fail, I'm not sure what they would do. I'd be worried that they would just be crushed mentally and give up.

So they probably feel sorry for me, and I sort of feel sorry for them.

Iâ€™ve gotten a couple of this book's concepts right, but am dreadfully off on not having any debt or credit cards. I sort of justify my debt as a business investment into a software system that I'm going to run until I do die.

So if I died tomorrow, I've been successful, as my condo cancels out my credit card debt.

On the other hand, my father recently turned 88 ...
