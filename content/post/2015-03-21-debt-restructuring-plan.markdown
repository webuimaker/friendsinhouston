My income has been pretty consistent each year, but during the year I have good months and bad months. That is, some months I invoice my recurring customers maybe twice as much as other months. And when I have a couple of low income months in a row, things get real tight.




This month I’ve hit a wall, as I’ve had two bad months in a row, combined with a large refund to a customer that was spamming people on my system. So I googled credit card debt repayment and found Money Management International. They are based here in Houston and are one of many organizations that work with consumers with too much credit card debt.




I worked with Maria and came up with a budget of my income and costs, and ways to save bits of money here and there. Since I don’t own a car, and my condo maintenance fees are really low, food was about the only item she could suggest cutting, as I do eat out a lot.




Then she offered to work with my credit card companies to pay off the credit cards over a 5 year period, at a reduced interest rate. The catch is that I have to stop using the credit cards.




Money Management International and other companies like them are non profit organizations, that are largely funded by the credit card companies. They have not charged me any fees, and their goal is to work out a plan that does not involve bankruptcy.




I owe about $50,000 in credit card debt, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to borrow the money, as it let me build my mailing list system. So my business is my asset, and the question becomes, will it provide enough income over the next few years to not only pay my current expenses, but also repay all the money I’ve borrowed.




The credit card companies have been my venture capital firm, but they don’t own any stock, nor has anybody been telling me how to run my business. That’s both good and bad :-)




My biggest weakness in spending is education. I’ve bought tens of thousands of dollars in marketing courses over the year, and I sure have not gotten much return on that money. Of course you actually have to do the work, and at best I’ve dabbled at marketing. I spend the bulk of my time either working on improving the software or providing support.




So the good news that I see in not having credit cards, is that I won’t be tempted to buy any more marketing courses. I could just retake all my existing classes and have more than enough to do.




So after 20 years of building a simple listserve, it’s time to see if I can make that system pay things back. The software is ready for prime time, I just need to switch from being a software developer to a marketing person and salesman.




Wish me luck !
