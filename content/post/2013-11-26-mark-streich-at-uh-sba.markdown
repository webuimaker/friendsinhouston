](/uploads/2013/12/UH_SBA.jpg)Houston businesses, you have a great resource for free at the [University of Houston SBA](http://www.sbdc.uh.edu/sbdc/default.asp) program. They have consultants, workshops, a business library and librarian, resources for selling to the government, and more.

And most of those services, including one on one consulting is free, courtesy of your tax dollars.

If you are a "High Tech" business, [Mark Streich](http://www.linkedin.com/in/markstreich) is the consultant you will work with. Mark has been a programmer/developer, including working for several startups in Silicon Valley. I've had 4 or 5 sessions with Mark, each lasting at least 90 minutes. His questions, suggestions and advice have been excellent.

All for free.

I've also worked with [Carey J. White](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/carey-j-white/34/b17/251), looking at the possibility of selling listserves to the Federal Government. She is also very knowledgable and professional and was able to dig up some leads for me in this obscure niche.

In addition to the positive feedback I've gotten from Mark Streich, there is the "opportunity for improvement" that I don't follow up on his suggestions. And there is some truth in there that I need to work on.

I think some of the advice us entrepreneurs get, we think we are already doing. While our advisors are saying, you need to do Much Much more of this. And some of the advice is not quite applicable at this stage of our business, due to our very limited resources.

Being our own boss is both a blessing and a curse, and if you want to succeed, you have to be willing to do the things that you don't necessarily want to do. So it's probably mandatory that you have some outside advisors, and follow their advice.

I've understood this for many years, but my desire for peace and quiet, has been stronger than my desire for a successful business.

No need for you to make the same mistake, and I highly recommend the University of Houston SBA in Midtown Houston.
