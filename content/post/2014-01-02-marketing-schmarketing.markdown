](/uploads/2014/01/marketing_schmarketing.jpeg)Although I graduated with a degree in Business Administration, I've always hated marketing. I've hated being marketed to and I despise the power that effective propaganda has over people. If we could figure out how to make marketing illegal, I would be all for that.

Effective marketing can make people do things that is not in their best interest. Coco-Cola spends billions of dollars every year to get us to use a product that ruins our health.

My major in college was Productions and Operations Management, which is oriented towards scientifically finding the optimal solution to manufacturing problems. No room for emotions or feelings, don't need to reach the subconscious, just the facts.

So now that I've created the best solution for email discussion groups, I am faced with the task of getting people to use it. The vast majority of likely prospects are already using a competing solution. Getting people to change to my solution is difficult.

Other prospects are using web based message boards, and getting them to change to an email based solution is even more difficult, maybe next to impossible.

Marketing is the process of getting the word out to my prospects, in a way that convinces them to try my product. And I do have a free 30 day trial, so there is no risk for them.

I've been running Google Adwords on and off for about 10 years. Mostly off, as for most of that time I was just not ready for new customers. And while I have my campaigns set up to track the results, I have yet to correlate even one sale with thousands of dollars of ad spend.

I sent out 2,500 postcards last year, to professional membership organizations, and got one phone call and no sales.

My lack of success so far does not come from a lack of education. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars in marketing education over the past 10 years. I like to learn new things, and marketing not only covers a vast number of topics, there are many subtle twists to learn. Sometimes changing the order of the words in a headline can be the difference between success and failure.

Most of my sales come from people finding me in the search engine. I usually appear on the first page if you know to search on the phrase - "listserv hosting". However, not that many of my prospects are familiar with the word listserv.

Successful marketing is a series of small steps, and if any one of those steps fail, no sale. You have to reach the right prospect, you have to capture their attention, and their interest. Your web site must make a good impression, or at least not a bad impression. You have to demonstrate trustworthiness. And you have to provide a solution to a burning problem of theirs, at a price that they can afford.

Each one of those steps is an art and a science, and while I've come a long ways in the past 2 years, I've got a long ways to go. For example, while I do have an auto responder set up, I only have 1 email to send them. Most marketing gurus would say I need to follow up at least 7 more times with a person to make a sale.

And while I know a lot about Google Adwords, it's a constantly changing environment, and it's costing me a couple of bucks every time somebody clicks on my ad. So there is lots of improvements to make, from understanding what words people use to search on, to the headlines in my ads.

Split testing is one of the most effective ways to improve your marketing, and I've got [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com) installed on my site. But I don't have any A/B tests set up. I'm just not sure what to test. Â And I don't get a lot of traffic, so it's going to take a long time to establish a winner.

As John Wesley Harding says in the song Bastard Son


<blockquote>I've only just started playing guitar and already they say I'm a has-been
Says my songs are too long, words are too strong, shoes aren't clean
See the synthesizer's broken, the 12 inchers don't exist
It's gonna take a blessed life to get on to the hitlist</blockquote>


Like most anything in life, marketing is a lot of hard work. So let me go roll up my sleeves and start applying some elbow grease, because there are a lot of people that need my mailing list system.

What do you think I should work on first ?
