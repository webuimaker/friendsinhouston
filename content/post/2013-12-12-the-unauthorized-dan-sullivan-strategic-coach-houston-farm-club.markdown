](/uploads/2013/12/strategic_coach.gif)Dan Sullivan runs [The Strategic Coach](http://www.strategiccoach.com/home.html), a business based on helping entrepreneurs grow their companies. He has a lot of unique ideas that I absolutely love, and seems to have a good reputation and repeat business, despite the fact that his coaching program costs $5,000 a year and up.

I'd join myself, except that he only accepts people that are netting at least $100,000 a year in personal income.

In addition to his private coaching classes, Dan has published a number of books and audio programs, and has a number of video's for free on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfZGlkx2uDQ).

So I've accumulated material from [his own store](http://private.strategiccoach.com/store/list), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Best-Get-Better-book/dp/1896635296), and even tracked down some older material on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.X%22dan+sullivan%22+-colts+-topps&_nkw=%22dan+sullivan%22+-colts+-topps&_sacat=0&_from=R40), [Powells Books](http://www.powells.com), and [Abe Books](http://www.abebooks.com).

I listen to his audios many times over, and actually take notes. One of the first time in my life I've ever made notes of anything. And I'm working on implementing his ideas and making them habits.

He's big on the ideas of having good habits, and adding new habits to reach your goals. That's contrary to my wanting to live life as an "Artiste", and do whatever I want as the mood strikes me.

He says to concentrate on just your unique abilities, and build a team that supports you in the other areas. And of course those people should have their own unique talents that match up to their tasks.

After about 12 years of doing everything myself, I have been migrating to working with teammates. RG II has been programming with me now for 6 years, and DSW has been webmaster, Wordpress guru, and all around Guy Friday for 3 years now.

One of his more unique ideas is that entrepreneurs should divide up their days into Free days, Focus days and Buffer days. And they should be taking lots of Free days to refresh and rejuvenate their minds. And Focus days should be spent primarily on money making activities.

I've been doing things the exact opposite, with 365 Buffer days a year. I do a little bit of everything every day, including Free time by working at a relaxed pace. Being a one man ISP running a 24 hour a day, 365 day business, sort of forces you to work every day.

Actually I like working every day, at least a little bit. And I'm not sure I even know what my money making activities are, much less doing them on a consistent basis. So this is proving a tough concept for me to implement.

If I had to name the single top motivator for me, it would be to make $100,000 a year so that I can join the real Strategic Coach program :-)

Got any Dan Sullivan experiences for me ?
