[The Rise of the Creative Class--Revisited: Revised and Expanded](http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Creative-Class--Revisited-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465042481/ref=sr_1_1) by Richard Florida, is the ten year anniversary edition of his original book published in 2002. The book tries to predict what factors are needed for economic growth, as we transition out of the Industrial Age.




This book reminds me of another book I read 25 years ago, that also looked into the future areas of growth in this country. [Regions of Opportunity](http://www.amazon.com/Regions-Opportunity-Jack-Lessinger/dp/0812911849/ref=sr_1_1) by Jack Lessinger predicted a migration of people from the suburbs to small towns outside of any metropolitan area. And not just any small towns, but those places that had originally been settled first as pioneers moved into different parts of the country. His logic was that those original spots were typically the most beautiful, and that same beauty was going to be very attractive in the future too.




Richard Florida defines three classes of people currently in the United States. The Working Class, doing routine physical work in manufacturing. The Service Class, those people doing low skill repetitive work, and the Creative Class, those people who use their minds to solve new problems.




Creative people include artists and musicians, but also scientists and computer programmers, architects and engineers, psychiatrists and psychologists. Professional managers, legal and financial people and even high end sales people are all in his Creative Class.




Florida says that real economic growth is only going to happen with the Creative Class, and that an area needs Technology, Talent and Tolerance in order to thrive in the future.




Technology and Talent seem fairly obvious, but I think that Florida is the first person to postulate that the Talent is attracted to areas where people are tolerant of each other. Places that have a high diversity of people. And that a large gay population is an important indicator of tolerance in a community.




Florida goes on to say the creative people like real architecture, not the generic franchise knockoffs that can be found anywhere. So they are repurposing old warehouses and industrial building for both their work and living spaces. And they want high density because of the benefits that random interactions with a wide variety of people can bring.




Creative people like to have the opportunity to participate in their entertainment, and that vibrant street scenes with a lot of variety are attractive to them. Spectator sports, symphonies, operas and ballet are of little interest to people in the Creative Class, especially the young Creatives.




Florida says that people used to migrate to where the jobs were, but now they migrate to a place that they like, and then worry about getting a job. And in many of the newly popular places, companies are opening up new campuses to fill their need for talented people.




Florida does not see any advantage in being in the Sun Belt to be attractive to the Creative Class, and holds Pittsburgh up as an example of a former Industrial Age powerhouse that is currently transitioning successfully to being Creative Class center. He mentions that Detroit has a high percentage of Creative people inside their city now, and they certainly have a surplus of old buildings that they can repurpose.




His prescription for making a location attractive to the Creative class would be stop wasting money on sports stadiums, and create parks, promote tolerance, and encourage the local music scene. He sees a high correlation between a vibrant music scene and a high percentage of people in the Creative class.




Austin ranks high in many of his categories for economic growth through Technology, Talent and Tolerance. Houston does not. Although Houston is so big and spread out, that many smaller areas rank higher in terms of percentages of his leading indicators.




When I first moved to Houston in 1980, there were many University of Texas graduates working in Houston, because there were few jobs for them in Austin. So while they really wanted to stay in Austin, there was no opportunity for the level of education they had obtained. In my case as a mainframe programmer, there were just not very many big companies headquartered in Austin that had a mainframe. The state government was about the only exception, and I had no interest in working there.




Since that time, many micro computer companies have either moved to Austin or sprung up there, and the trend is only accelerating. Austin has a beautiful park system, a vibrant music scene, and a historical tolerance for weirdness that creative people desire.




Even 175 years ago, people recognized the natural beauty and better weather, and moved the state capital from Houston to Austin. With the advent of air conditioning, the weather is not as important of a factor, but Houston is never going to be able to change that condition.




I think there is at least one Houston based company that has opened a Research and Development center in Portland, as they were unable to attract any of the best and brightest graduates to Houston.




Houston has technology in the form of Rice and University of Houston. The Medical Center and the Oil and Gas companies in Houston are probably even more important than our education centers, as they employ tens of thousands of highly educated people doing cutting edge work. So while there are more people in the Creative Class in Houston than most any other location in the United States, there are also lots of Working Class people too, as Houston is one of the top manufacturing center in this country. So the percentage of Creative Class to the overall population is smaller than lots of other places.




Houston is changing, and I was surprised when voters approved $100 million for the Bayou Greenways Park Project in 2012, with a 66% majority. A few years earlier, the Discovery Green park was created in Downtown Houston. And the Buffalo Bayou Park project is a $55 million dollar makeover of a 2.3 stretch of the bayou near downtown. There are wide bike trails, and smaller walking trails on both sides of the bayou, and at least 3 new bridges to connect the north and south side for recreational use. I ride my bike their frequently, and it's not only beautiful, it attracts a lot of people.




Houston has tolerance and diversity in spades. Houston has a large gay population, a high percentage of people born in foreign countries, and the first openly gay mayor of a large city in the United States. So I think Houston has the Technology, Talent and Tolerance components that Florida touts in large numbers, even though the ratios do not rank as high as many smaller cities like Austin, Portland, Raleigh, or Santa Barbara.




And at the moment, Houston is attracting new comers at a tremendous rate, and there is astonishing growth and new construction in almost all parts of the cities. And those people are coming for the jobs, not because Houston is a mecca for hipsters.




While Houston is never going to be able to rank as high in natural beauty and weather as many other places in this country, it's relative lack of regulation and pro business attitude offers advantages that Florida does not recognize or try to enumerate. This is especially true for larger companies, as many of Florida's top places are too small to support companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.




Houston will do just fine for the foreseeable future in harnessing the Creative Class for real economic growth.
